## 2026-01-11 21:15 - CRITICAL: Multi-Agent Worktree Collision

**Session Type:** Critical protocol violation - simultaneous worktree allocation
**Context:** User reported "you were working with 2 agents on the same worktree and on the same problem"
**Outcome:** ⚠️ CRITICAL FAILURE - Two agents worked on feature/chunk-set-summaries simultaneously

### Problem Statement

**User Report:** Two agent sessions allocated the same worktree (agent-001, feature/chunk-set-summaries) and worked on the same problem simultaneously.

**Actual Violation:**
- ❌ No pre-allocation conflict detection performed
- ❌ Did not check `git worktree list` before allocating
- ❌ Did not check `instances.map.md` for existing sessions on branch
- ❌ No mechanism to detect or prevent race conditions
- ❌ Agents did not notify each other of collision

### Root Cause Analysis

**Missing Conflict Detection:**

The current worktree allocation protocol (Pattern 52) only checks:
1. ✅ Pool status (BUSY/FREE)
2. ✅ Base repo branch state

But DOES NOT check:
- ❌ `git worktree list` (shows ALL active worktrees regardless of pool status)
- ❌ `instances.map.md` (shows active agent sessions)
- ❌ Recent activity log for same branch

**Race Condition:**
- Agent A checks pool → sees FREE
- Agent B checks pool → sees FREE (simultaneously)
- Agent A marks BUSY and starts work
- Agent B marks BUSY (different seat) and starts work on SAME BRANCH
- Result: Both agents working on same branch in different worktree directories

**Why This Is Critical:**
- Git conflicts and merge issues
- Wasted effort (duplicate work)
- Potential data loss if both push to same branch
- Violates fundamental isolation principle of worktree strategy

### User Mandate

**Exact words**: "when this happens again both of you should be able to notify each other and then one of the agents should say 'there is already another agent working in this branch'"

**Requirements**:
1. Agents MUST detect conflicts BEFORE allocation
2. Agents MUST notify when conflict detected
3. One agent MUST back off with standard message
4. Implement prevention mechanism, not just detection

### Solution Implemented

**Created**: `C:\scripts\_machine\MULTI_AGENT_CONFLICT_DETECTION.md`

**New Protocol**:

1. **Pre-Allocation Conflict Check** (MANDATORY):
   ```bash
   # Check git worktrees
   git worktree list | grep <branch>
   # If found → STOP with message

   # Check instances.map.md
   grep <branch> instances.map.md
   # If found → STOP with message
   ```

2. **Conflict Message** (MANDATORY):
   ```
   🚨 CONFLICT DETECTED 🚨
   There is already another agent working in this branch.

   I will NOT proceed with allocation to avoid conflicts.
   ```

3. **Enhanced Allocation**:
   - Run conflict check FIRST
   - Only proceed if no conflicts
   - Update instances.map.md IMMEDIATELY after allocation
   - Implement heartbeat mechanism (update timestamp every 30 min)

4. **Enhanced Release**:
   - Clean up instances.map.md entry
   - Commit all tracking files together

5. **Helper Script**:
   - Created `check-branch-conflicts.sh` for quick validation

### Pattern Added to Documentation

**Updated Files**:
- ✅ Created: `MULTI_AGENT_CONFLICT_DETECTION.md` (complete protocol)
- ✅ Updated: `CLAUDE.md` - Added mandatory conflict check as step 0a in ATOMIC ALLOCATION
- ✅ Created: `tools/check-branch-conflicts.sh` - Helper script for automated conflict detection
- ⏳ TODO: Update `worktrees.protocol.md` with conflict detection steps (if needed)
- ⏳ TODO: Update `ZERO_TOLERANCE_RULES.md` with multi-agent rule (if needed)

### Lessons Learned

**❌ What Went Wrong**:
1. Assumed pool status was sufficient for conflict detection
2. Did not cross-reference with git's actual worktree state
3. Did not use instances.map.md effectively
4. No mechanism for agents to "see" each other

**✅ What to Do Differently**:
1. ALWAYS check `git worktree list` before allocation
2. ALWAYS check `instances.map.md` before allocation
3. Update instances.map.md immediately after successful allocation
4. Clean up instances.map.md on release
5. Implement heartbeat for long-running work
6. Output standard conflict message when detected

**🔑 Key Insight**:
The worktree pool tracks SEATS (agent directories), but multiple seats can attempt to use the SAME BRANCH. The pool doesn't prevent branch-level conflicts, only seat-level conflicts. Need to check at BOTH levels.

### Success Criteria Moving Forward

**You are following multi-agent protocol correctly ONLY IF:**
- ✅ Run `git worktree list | grep <branch>` before EVERY allocation
- ✅ Run `grep <branch> instances.map.md` before EVERY allocation
- ✅ Output conflict message if ANY conflict detected
- ✅ NEVER proceed with allocation if conflict exists
- ✅ Update instances.map.md after successful allocation
- ✅ Clean instances.map.md on release

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE - User has zero tolerance for this violation.**

### Action Items

**Completed** (2026-01-11 21:30):
- ✅ Create MULTI_AGENT_CONFLICT_DETECTION.md - Complete protocol document (353 lines)
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md with reference to new protocol - Added as step 0a in ATOMIC ALLOCATION section
- ✅ Create check-branch-conflicts.sh helper script - Full 4-check validation script (105 lines)
- ✅ Test conflict detection mechanism - Verified with hazina repo tests (working correctly)

**Implementation Complete**:
The multi-agent conflict detection protocol is now fully operational. All agents MUST run pre-allocation conflict checks before allocating any worktree.

**Next Session**:
- Use helper script before any allocation: `bash C:/scripts/tools/check-branch-conflicts.sh <repo> <branch>`
- Document any edge cases discovered during real usage
- Consider updating worktrees.protocol.md and ZERO_TOLERANCE_RULES.md if patterns emerge
