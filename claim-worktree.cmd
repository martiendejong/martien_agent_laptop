REM claim-worktree.cmd - Claim a FREE agent worktree and checkout git worktrees
REM Usage: claim-worktree.cmd <branch-name> [task-description]
REM Example: claim-worktree.cmd feature/new-feature "Implementing new feature X"
REM
REM This script:
REM 1. Finds a FREE agent from worktrees.pool.md
REM 2. Ensures base repos (client-manager, hazina) are on develop and up-to-date
REM 3. Creates git worktrees for both repos in the agent folder
REM 4. Marks the agent as BUSY in the pool
REM 5. Logs the allocation in worktrees.activity.md
REM
REM WARNING: This script modifies critical worktree pool files.
REM          Only one instance should run at a time to prevent conflicts.
