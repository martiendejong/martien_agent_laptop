REM --- OpenCode Autonomous Agent ---
REM --- Based on claude_agent.bat structure ---
REM --- Features: ---
REM --- 1. Explicit file reading instructions at startup ---
REM --- 2. Self-improvement mandate built into prompt ---
REM --- 3. Cross-repo dependency awareness ---
REM --- 4. Parallel agent coordination ---
REM --- 5. CI/CD troubleshooting capabilities ---
REM --- 6. Machine-wide resource management ---

REM --- OpenCode Configuration ---
REM NOTE: OpenCode uses a different approach than Claude Code
REM It supports custom agents via configuration files
REM For now, we'll use the default interactive mode
REM To configure custom behavior, use: opencode agent command

REM --- Start OpenCode ---
