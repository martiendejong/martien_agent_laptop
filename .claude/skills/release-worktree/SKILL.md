# Release Agent Worktree

**Purpose:** Clean up worktree, release seat, update tracking files, and return base repos to develop after PR creation.

## CRITICAL: When to Release

**Release IMMEDIATELY after:**
- ✅ Code changes committed
- ✅ Changes pushed to remote
- ✅ PR created with `gh pr create`

**BEFORE:**
- ❌ Presenting PR link to user
- ❌ Marking task as complete

## Release Protocol (Zero-Tolerance Checklist)

### Step 1: Verify PR Created

```bash
# Check PR exists on GitHub
gh pr view <pr-number> --repo <owner>/<repo>
```

**If no PR exists, CREATE IT FIRST before releasing.**

### Step 2: Clean Worktree Directory

```bash
# Remove ALL worktree contents
rm -rf C:/Projects/worker-agents/agent-XXX/*
```

**Why:** Prevents disk space accumulation, ensures clean slate for next allocation.

### Step 3: Mark Seat FREE

Edit `C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.pool.md`:
- Change status from BUSY to FREE
- Clear Current repo field (set to `-`)
- Clear Branch field (set to `-`)
- Update Last activity timestamp
- Add note about completed work (e.g., "✅ Feature X implemented (PR #123)")

### Step 4: Log Release

Add entry to `C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.activity.md`:
```
## <timestamp> - Release: agent-XXX
- Repo: <repo-name>
- Branch: <branch-name>
- PR: #<number>
- Outcome: <PR title or brief description>
```

### Step 5: Remove from instances.map.md

Remove the line for this agent from `C:/scripts/_machine/instances.map.md`.

### Step 6: Switch Base Repos to Develop

```bash
# client-manager
cd C:/Projects/client-manager
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# hazina
cd C:/Projects/hazina
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
```

### Step 7: Prune Worktrees

```bash
# Remove worktree references from git
git -C C:/Projects/client-manager worktree prune
git -C C:/Projects/hazina worktree prune
```

### Step 8: Commit Tracking Files

```bash
cd C:/scripts
git add _machine/worktrees.pool.md
git add _machine/worktrees.activity.md
git add _machine/instances.map.md
git commit -m "chore: Release agent-XXX after <brief description> (PR #<number>)"
git push origin main
```

### Step 9: Verify Release Complete

```bash
# Check worktree directory is empty
ls C:/Projects/worker-agents/agent-XXX/

# Check pool.md shows FREE
grep "agent-XXX" C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.pool.md

# Check base repos on develop
git -C C:/Projects/client-manager branch --show-current
git -C C:/Projects/hazina branch --show-current

# Check git worktree list (should not show released worktree)
git -C C:/Projects/client-manager worktree list
git -C C:/Projects/hazina worktree list
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Release successful ONLY IF:**
- Worktree directory cleaned (`rm -rf agent-XXX/*`)
- Seat marked FREE in pool.md
- Release logged in activity.md
- Entry removed from instances.map.md
- Both base repos on develop branch
- Worktrees pruned (git worktree prune)
- Tracking files committed and pushed
- THEN (and only then) present PR to user

## Critical Rules

❌ **NEVER:**
- Present PR to user before releasing worktree
- Skip cleanup of worktree directory
- Forget to mark seat FREE
- Leave base repo on feature branch
- Skip committing tracking file updates

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Complete ALL 9 steps in order
- Verify each step before proceeding
- Commit tracking files together
- Present PR link AFTER release complete

## Reference Files

- Protocol: `C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.protocol.md`
- Zero-tolerance rules: `C:/scripts/ZERO_TOLERANCE_RULES.md`
- Pool status: `C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.pool.md`

## Example: Complete Release

```bash
# 1. Verify PR exists
gh pr view 123 --repo user/client-manager

# 2. Clean worktree
rm -rf C:/Projects/worker-agents/agent-001/*

# 3-5. Update tracking files (pool.md, activity.md, instances.map.md)

# 6. Switch to develop
cd C:/Projects/client-manager && git checkout develop && git pull
cd C:/Projects/hazina && git checkout develop && git pull

# 7. Prune worktrees
git -C C:/Projects/client-manager worktree prune
git -C C:/Projects/hazina worktree prune

# 8. Commit tracking files
cd C:/scripts
git add _machine/*.md
git commit -m "chore: Release agent-001 after new feature (PR #123)"
git push origin main

# 9. Verify
ls C:/Projects/worker-agents/agent-001/  # Should be empty or show only .git dirs
grep "agent-001" C:/scripts/_machine/worktrees.pool.md  # Should show FREE
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Worktree directory not empty after rm -rf":**
- Check for permission issues
- Verify correct path: `C:/Projects/worker-agents/agent-XXX/`
- Close any editors or terminals in that directory

**"Base repo still on feature branch":**
- Worktree might still be linked
- Run `git worktree prune` first
- Then `git checkout develop`

**"Can't commit tracking files":**
- Check you're in C:/scripts directory
- Verify git status shows modified files
- Ensure no merge conflicts in tracking files

## PR Presentation Template

**After completing ALL release steps, present to user:**

```
✅ PR Created: #<number>
Title: <PR title>
URL: https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<number>

Changes:
- <bullet point summary>

Worktree released, seat agent-XXX now FREE.
```

## Violation Recovery

**If you presented PR before releasing:**

1. STOP immediately
2. Read `C:/scripts/_machine/reflection.log.md` § 2026-01-08 02:00
3. Execute ALL release steps now
4. Update reflection.log.md with violation entry
5. Commit corrective action

**This is a CRITICAL VIOLATION. Zero tolerance.**
